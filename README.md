## Project Abstract
BuckIt! is an application that allows users to create their own personal bucket list. This app also serves as a location-based activity suggestion platform which will enable locals to post suggestions for activities and example itineraries for other people to see. The suggestions that are posted can be upvoted or downvoted by other users to allow others to see which events are most popular in the area. Suggestions also allow for comments by other users to give additional information so that users can be well informed and prepared. Through our applicationâ€™s interface, users will have access to activities suggested by locals which means that tourists will have local knowledge of which activities are fun to do, or which item on the restaurant menu is the most popular. This means that tourists will have the most authentic experience possible during their trips. Our application will always have popular activity recommendations so that our users will always have something to do wherever they are located.
